Creating a virtualenv will create a virtual python environment with preinstalled pip, setuptools and wheels.Is there a way to specify what packages to pre-install in that virtualenv apart from those 3 default ones? Either with CLI arguments, a file, or environment variables of some sort. I.e. is there something along the lines of virtualenv venv && venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt which can be run in one command?                                                            python virtualenv                                                                                                             se-share-sheet#willShow s-popover:shown->se-share-sheet#didShow\\\">ShareShare a link to this question (Includes your user id)Copy linkCC BY-SA 3.0                                                                Edit                                                                        Follow                Follow this question to receive notifications                                                                        asked Jan 2 '17 at 13:10                                Ilia SidorenkoIlia Sidorenko                    1,46933 gold badges2222 silver badges2828 bronze badges                                                    6                                                                                         2                                                                        You answered your own question.

To break your text into sections, you can use headers:                                A Large Header\\r==============\\r\\rSmaller Subheader\\r-----------------                                    Use hash marks if you need several levels of headers:                                # Header 1 #\\r## Header 2 ##\\r### Header 3 ###                                                Both bulleted and numbered lists are possible:            - Use a minus sign for a bullet+ Or plus sign* Or an asterisk1. Numbered lists are easy2. Markdown keeps track of   the numbers for you7. So this will be item 3.                        1. Lists in a list item:    - Indented four spaces.        * indented eight spaces.    - Four spaces again.2.  You can have multiple    paragraphs in a list items.     Just be sure to indent.                                                                > Create a blockquote by\\r> prepending “>” to each line.\\r>\\r> Other formatting also works here, e.g.\\r>\\r> 1.

To create code blocks or other preformatted text, indent by four spaces or surround with groups of backticks:                            This will be displayed in a monospaced font. The first four spaces    will be stripped off, but all other whitespace will be preserved.```Markdown and HTML are turned off in code blocks:<i>This is not italic</i>, and [this is not a link](https://example.com)```                            To create not a block, but an inline code span, use backticks:                        The `$` character is just a shortcut for `window.jQuery`.                            If you want to have a preformatted block within a list, indent by eight spaces:                        1. This is normal text.2. So is this, but now follows a code block:         Skip a line and indent eight spaces.        That's four spaces for the list        and four to trigger the code block.                                                    If you need to do something that Markdown can't handle, use HTML. Note that we only support a very strict subset of HTML!                        Strikethrough humor is <strike>funny</strike>.                            Markdown is smart enough not to mangle your span-level HTML:                        <b>Markdown works *fine* in here.</b>                            Block-level HTML elements have a few restrictions:                                        They must be separated from surrounding text by blank lines.                The begin and end tags of the outermost block element must not be indented.                Markdown can't be used within HTML blocks.                                    <pre>    You can <em>not</em> use Markdown in here.</pre>                                                    You can create tables using the GitHub-flavored markdown format.                        | A header | Another header |\\r| -------- | -------------- |\\r| First    | row            |\\r| Second   | row            |                            A header row is required and must be followed by a separator row with the same number of cells                Cells are separated by a pipe (|) symbol                                        Set the alignment of a table column by placing a : on the left, right, or both sides of a separator in the separator line.                        | left | center | right |\\r|:---- |:------:| -----:|\\r| One  | Two    | Three |                                                                                                                                                                    Thanks for contributing an answer to Stack Overflow!Please be sure to answer the question.
