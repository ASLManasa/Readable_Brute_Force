## About The Project

You probably have visited sites before containing bad words, which might have caught you off guard. Suddenly stumbling upon these sites aren't exactly a good experience. We've made it easy for you to surf the web safely. Install our extension by visiting our site.
overview: [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1PeL0wF5oXjB9fPtbQx9tK8Hi0WXGCoKE5ns4LptANcQ/edit?usp=sharing)

### Built With

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/)
- [ChakraUI](https://chakra-ui.com/)

## Challenges We ran intoðŸ”´
 The biggest challenge we encountered was training the ml model since the model's accuracy was insufficient, thus we used a python tool to solve the problem. The second difficulty was that we couldn't update the DOM components to show the readability in the extension; as a result, we used an alert box instead.
 
 ## Accomplishments that I'm proud ofðŸŽ–
I was able to create our proper working extension extension along with the website(that had the extension). I learned more about webscrapping that I was new to. At last how to deploy a web application to vercel.

## What I learnedðŸ“š
I got more experience in **Nextjs and web scrapping** by building this application.  Got to learn about different web scrapping techniques systems and how everything interacts in the web application during auth. I also wished to integrate this in the google playstore so that it be available to a wider audience.

## What's next for Instagram Post-Sharing-Web-AppðŸŽ‰
- To blur vulgar Images <br>
- To ADD Age Constraints <br>
- To Deploy it in Cloud  <br>
- ADD our extension on Chrome web store  <br>
